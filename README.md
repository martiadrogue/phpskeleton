**Note:** Replace ```:package_name``` ```:package_description``` with their
correct values in [README.md](README.md), [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md), [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) and
[composer.json](composer.json) files, then delete this line.

This is where your description should go. Try and limit it to a paragraph or
two, and maybe throw in a mention of what PSRs you support to avoid any
confusion with users and contributors.

Inspired by phpleague/skeleton, peterkokot/php-skeleton and koriym/PHP.Skeleton.
